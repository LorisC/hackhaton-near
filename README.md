Context 
No Trash Alliance NTA in short is a project for The Global Hack Bounty.

The aim of this project is to create the foundation for an association of garbage collector / processor company to track recyclable waste around the world.

In 1997, the American oceanographer Charles Moore discovered the first vortex of waste in the sea: an area of 3.4 million square kilometers contaminated by floating plastic waste.

Part of this plastic waste is due to garbage collector/ processor “losing” a part of the waste while transiting them from a processing site to another.

With an association like NTA where every member agreed to tracker their waste until their waste is totally recycled can help reduce the amount of waste lost and create a new economy for the trashes.
Indeed, with the global warming and green gas more and more companies a trying to find a way to reduce their waste and/or recycled it.
